# Pre-workshop Checklist

This checklist aims to help organize Carpentry Workshops at the Smithsonian. 

## Workshop Instructors and Helpers

* Co-instructors (teaching in pairs is recommended by The Carpentries)
	* List of SI Carpentry instructors can be found [here](https://datascience.si.edu/carpentries#instructors).
* Helpers (one helper for every 8-10 learners)
	* We suggest the instructors invite new helpers from their respective departments and help us grow our SI Carpentries Community.
	* [Helpers cheat sheet](https://github.com/mtntsuchiya/instructor-training/blob/gh-pages/files/handouts/helpers.pdf)

## Checking space availability and reserving a room

* Access the SI Room Reservation System [here](https://fc.si.edu/)
* Hereâ€™s the Prism resource for reservable rooms around the various museums: [http://prism2.si.edu/collaboration/pages/mtgplanning.aspx](http://prism2.si.edu/collaboration/pages/mtgplanning.aspx)
* You can select the room based on seating capacity, location, equipment available, etc.
	* NMNH: 
		* For large workshops: WG-33 (Vertebrate Zoology Seminar Room). It has enough room for 50 people.
		* Library CE107 and CE108 combined: 30 people
		* NMNH Library Learning Lab: counted 16 computers (good for interns w/o laptops)
		* Rose Room: Listed as a capacity of 25, but we had ~40 in there for the first workshop.
	* NZP
		* Conference Room at DCB
	* SAAM
		* MacMillan Education Center: it can probably accommodate 20 people at the big conference table. Contact Ryan Linthicum, [LinthicumR@si.edu](mailto:LinthicumR@si.edu) to reserve.
	* SERC
		* Matthias 1013
* To reserve the Castle Library, email [CastleScheduler@si.edu](mailto:CastleScheduler@si.edu) with a request for dates.
* To add: How to request chairs for the Castle Library

## Accessibility

* Make sure the workshop room and restrooms are accessible. 
	* Check the path from the entrance to the workshop room and from the room to the restrooms to be sure.
* Microphone and speaker
* Color-blind safe sticky notes 
	* Blue and yellow seem to be a good color combo. See it [here](http://www.colourblindawareness.org/colour-blindness/)
* Lactation room

## Equipment and Materials

### Required Items

* Sticky notes (blue=good/yellow=help), or any combination with the same meaning)
	* 8 of each color per person
* Power strips
	* One power strip for every 3 learners 
	* A few extensions cords
* Extension cords
* For the Castle Library: Projector (Matt K. has one that can be borrowed)
* Wireless lavalier microphone, portable speaker and atleast eight extra AA batteries (see Matt K.)

### Nice-to-haves

* Direction signs to the workshop room
* Name tags or tents
* Pronoun stickers would be a great addition to future workshops
* Stickers and other swag
* Flipchart or whiteboard with felt-tip pen (from The Carpentries Website although we haven't been using these in our workshops)
* Coffee and snacks
  * The SI Data Science lab has a coffee urn for use in workshops. It takes about 1.5 hours to brew a full pot.
  * The best spot to fill the urn in the Castle is a water bottle filling station in the basement near the staff food service.
  * The coffee recipie is 2 cups grounds to make a full urn (40 cups)
